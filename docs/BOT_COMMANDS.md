## Overview

The Roxonn GitHub Bot (`@roxonn`) automates bounty creation, claiming, and payouts directly from GitHub issues and pull requests. There are **two types of bounties**:

1. **Pool Bounties** - Funded by repository pool managers from pre-funded pools (requires repo registration)
2. **Community Bounties** - Funded by any user on any public repository (permissionless, no registration required)

### Authentication & Permissions

| Action | Authentication Required | Special Permissions |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Create pool bounty | ✅ Yes (pool manager) | Must be registered pool manager |
| Create community bounty | ✅ Yes (any GitHub user) | None - permissionless |
| Claim bounty | ✅ Yes (PR author) | Must have merged PR that closes issue |
| Check status | ❌ No | Public information |
| Request bounty | ❌ No | Creates request for pool managers to review |

---

## Command Syntax Reference

All commands can be invoked with either `/` or `@roxonn` prefix:

| Command | Slash Syntax | Mention Syntax | Type |
|---------|--------------|----------------|------|
| Pool bounty | `/bounty pool <amount> <currency>` | `@roxonn bounty pool <amount> <currency>` | Pool |
| Community bounty | `/bounty <amount> <currency>` | `@roxonn bounty <amount> <currency>` | Community |
| Claim | `/claim #<PR number>` | N/A | Both |
| Status | N/A | `@roxonn status` | Both |
| Request | `/bounty` | `@roxonn bounty` | Pool |

---

## Pool Bounties

Pool bounties are funded from a **repository's pre-funded bounty pool**, managed by designated pool managers. Requires repository registration on Roxonn platform.

### Command: `/bounty pool <amount> <currency>`

Allocates a bounty from the repository's pool to the current issue.

#### Syntax
```
/bounty pool <amount> <currency>
```

#### Parameters
- `<amount>` - Bounty amount (decimal, 0.00000001 - 1000000)
- `<currency>` - One of: `XDC`, `ROXN`, `USDC`

#### Examples
```
/bounty pool 100 USDC
```
Creates a 100 USDC pool bounty on the current issue.

```
@roxonn bounty pool 50 XDC
```
Creates a 50 XDC pool bounty using mention syntax.

```
/bounty pool 250.50 ROXN
```
Creates a 250.50 ROXN pool bounty with decimal amount.

#### Preconditions
✅ **Required:**
- Repository must be registered on Roxonn platform
- Commenter must be a **pool manager** for this repository
- Pool must have sufficient balance for `<amount>` + gas fees
- Issue must NOT already have a pool bounty allocated

❌ **Not Allowed:**
- Non-pool managers cannot allocate from pool

The bounty will be paid out automatically when this issue is closed with a merged PR.
```

#### Failure Responses

**1. Not a Pool Manager**
```markdown
❌ Error: Unauthorized

Only pool managers can allocate bounties from the repository pool.
Current pool managers: @alice, @bob

To create a personal bounty, use: /bounty 100 USDC (without "pool")
```

**2. Insufficient Pool Balance**
```markdown
❌ Error: Insufficient Pool Balance

Requested: 100 USDC
Available: 45.30 USDC

Please fund the pool or allocate a smaller amount.

```

**3. Bounty Already Exists**
```markdown
❌ Error: Bounty Already Exists

This issue already has a pool bounty allocated: 50 USDC

```markdown
❌ Error: Repository Not Registered

## Community Bounties

Community bounties are **permissionless** bounties that any user can create on any public GitHub repository without requiring repository registration or pool manager approval.

### Command: `/bounty <amount> <currency>`

1. **Create** bounty (this command) → Status: `pending_payment`
2. **Pay** bounty (via provided link) → Status: `funded`

#### Syntax
```
/bounty <amount> <currency>
```

⚠️ **Note:** Omitting `pool` keyword creates a **community bounty** (new default behavior)

#### Parameters
- `<amount>` - Bounty amount (decimal, 0.00000001 - 1000000)
- `<currency>` - One of: `XDC`, `ROXN`, `USDC`

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not recognized"

- ✅ Use lowercase: `/bounty` not `/BOUNTY`
- ✅ Ensure no typos: `/claim #42` not `/cliam #42`

### "Bounty not showing up"
- ⏳ Pool bounties are created instantly (blockchain confirmation takes 10-30 seconds)
- ⏳ Community bounties require payment first (status `pending_payment` until paid)
- ⏳ Refresh issue page or check blockchain explorer

### "Payment link not working"
- 🔄 Try alternative payment method (crypto vs fiat)
- 🔄 Check wallet connection (XDCPay, MetaMask)
- 🔄 Verify sufficient balance + gas fees
- 📧 Contact support: support@roxonn.com

### "Claim not processing"
- ⏳ Wait 1-2 minutes for relayer service (runs every 30 seconds)
- ✅ Verify PR is actually merged (not just approved)
- ✅ Verify PR body contains "fixes #X" or "closes #X"
- ✅ Check bounty status: `@roxonn status`

### "Payout failed"
- ❌ Check relayer logs for verification errors
- ❌ Verify wallet address is correct
- ❌ Ensure PR meets all verification criteria
- 📧 Contact support with bounty ID

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between pool and community bounties?**
A: Pool bounties are funded from a repository's pre-funded pool (instant, requires registration). Community bounties are funded individually by any user (requires payment step, no registration).

**Q: Can I create a bounty on a private repository?**
A: Only pool bounties support private repositories (requires registration). Community bounties are public repositories only.

**Q: What are the fees?**
A:
- Pool bounties: 0% fees (fully paid from pool)
- Community bounties: 1% total (0.5% platform + 0.5% contributor support fund)

**Q: How long until payout after PR merge?**
A:
- Pool bounties: Automatic when issue closes (requires pool manager present)
- Community bounties: 30-60 seconds (relayer service verification)

**Q: Can I cancel a bounty?**
A:
- Pool bounties: Contact pool manager to deallocate
- Community bounties: Refund available after expiry date (if unclaimed)

**Q: What if my PR doesn't have "fixes #X" in the body?**
A: The relayer requires this keyword to verify the PR closes the issue. Edit your PR description to include "fixes #123" or "closes #123".

**Q: Can multiple people claim the same bounty?**
A: No - first successful claim wins. Status changes to `claimed` immediately, preventing duplicates.

**Q: What happens if I don't pay a community bounty?**
A: Bounty remains in `pending_payment` status indefinitely. It won't be visible to contributors and can't be claimed. You can pay anytime via the payment link.
